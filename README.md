# IoT School Project from my third year at CÃ©gep de Sorel-Tracy
## Typescript API for a IOS/WatchOS application

The IOS App was used to register a two-factor authentication to a website using a QR code. The two-factor authentication was a movement combination registered with the watchOS application.

This API was used to receive HTTP requests from the IOS app to register combinations and websites using this system to verify those.
